 A python program for using the main principle of perturbation theory to predic 
 the coupling streght between cavity magnon polaritons detailed in:

 MacÃªdo, Rair, Rory C. Holland, Paul G. Baity, Karen L. Livesey, 
 Robert L. Stamps, Martin P. Weides, and Dmytro A. Bozhko. "An electromagnetic 
 approach to cavity spintronics" Phys. Rev. Applied (In press)/arXiv:2007.11483

 While this program can be easily modified for different systems, we recommend 
 to start using the it in combination with the article above in order to 
 understand the different features presented as well as to better undestand 
 how to relate the quatities calculated and parameters given to other systems. 
 
 Here you'll find:

    * Calculation of the coupling using analytical solutions for the field 
      profiles in a rectangular microwave cavity. This include plots of (a) the 
      field profile (b) the eigenfrequencies of the system, (c) the coupling as 
      a function of x,y positions and (d) the coupling as a fuction of y 
      position at x = 27 mm (anti-node of the cavity's magnetic field). 

    * Eigenfrequencies for a 2D resonator (coplanar waveguide) coupled to a Py 
      film with field and energies inputs from COMSOL.
      
    * S11 parameter calculations.
    
 A few additional points worthy of note: 
 
    * Note that throughout this file, parameters are given for the relevant 
      sections and these might be updated with different names later in the 
      file for different sytems. 

    * This code is written sequentially so that sections can be deleted 
      bottom-up. Therefore, if sections are deleted top-down or from the middle
      the code might not run properly--or at all.
